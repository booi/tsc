# Topic

A Topic is a node in CSPA topic tree.  The full tree is displayed here: https://cspa.io/topics.  It is a string-based tag.  Questions are associated with zero or more Topics.

## Inheritance

If a Question is tagged by a Topic, it inherits all ancestor Topics implicitly.

TODO: Include the actual TopicTree.json, and allow TSC members to update it.
